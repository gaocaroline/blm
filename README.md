# Black lives matter: The Role of Group Membership and Likability in Exhaustivity Inference #

Intro goes here!

## Experiment 1 ##
The initial norming experiment was intended to obtain participant ratings of 36 different predicates on a sliding scale in order to determine which predicates were considered highly positive, highly negative, and somewhat neutral in valence. We used the results of this experiment to determine which predicates would be used in the target experiment. 

### Method ###
### Participants ###
We recruited 20 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time.

### Design and Methods ###
We asked participants to make a judgment as to whether they thought a predicate was positive, negative, or neutral by answering the question ("How good or bad is it to [predicate]?"). 36 different predicates were tested, where 12 each were informally hypothesized to have relatively high (positive), relatively low (negative), and relatively moderate (neutral) mean ratings. Each participant completed 36 trials, where in each trial, they indicated their answer to the standard question about the predicate by adjusting a slider with endpoints labeled "Very good" on the far right and "Very bad" on the far left. On each trial, we measured the distance of the slider from the left endpoint: values ranged from 0 to 1. We analyzed data from all participants. 

### Results ###
For each predicate, we computed its mean rating by taking the average across all trials completed by all participants that asked about that predicate. 

![Figure 1](../master/results_experiments/1_norming/graphs/means.pdf "Figure 1. Mean rating of predicates tested in the norming study, clustered according to their hypothesized category (positive, negative, and neutral).") presents the mean rating for each predicate, separated into 3 bins depending on whether we hypothesized that it would be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Greater values mean that a participant thought a predicate was more positive, where lesser values mean that a participant judged a predicate as more negative. When examining the general pattern of results in Figure 1, it becomes apparent that, in general, the predicates hypothesized to be positive all had mean ratings of 0.7 or higher, in accordance with our hypothesis. Similarly, the predicates hypothesized to be negative predominantly had mean ratings of 0.25 or lower. However, from the data it becomes evident that the majority of the predicates hypothesized to be neutral had mean ratings of 0.6 or higher, suggesting that participants thought they were more positive than neutral. 

## Experiment 2 ##
The second experiment sought to examine our primary hypothesis that the strength and rate of exhaustivity inference would depend on the valence of the predicate (positive versus negative versus neutral) as well as group membership (in-group or out-group) and participant rating of group likability for the given noun. 

### Participants ###
We recruited 400 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time. 

### Design and Methods ###
**Production block.** Participants were asked to choose which one of four responses ("All lives matter", "Yes, Black lives matter", "No, Black lives don't matter", "Not all Black lives matter") to a statement consisting of a noun representing a group of people (e.g. "men", "Republicans") paired with a predicate (e.g. "are competent", "cheat") most aligned with how they would naturally respond to the statement. Statements consisted of a noun paired with a predicate. Participants responded to 16 positive statements, where each of eight target nouns was paired with a random two positive predicates (chosen from a collection of six positive predicates), as well as 16 negative statements where each of the target nouns was paired with a random two negative predicates (chosen from a collection of six negative predicates). All predicates were chosen from those evaluated in the norming study, and the positive and negative predicates were as complementary as possible. Participants also responded to 8 neutral statements where each pair of complementary nouns (men/women, Americans/Europeans) was randomly paired with one of four neutral predicates, and four filler statements (two true, two false) intended to serve as a measure of attention. Finally, every participant responded to the statement, "Black lives matter," leading to a total of 45 statements. All nouns and predicates shown in the target study are listed in Appendix B, Table 1, and Table 2. The order of the four responses as well as the order of all trials in the production, likability, and identity blocks were randomized between subjects. 

**Identity block.** We asked participants to report whether or not they identified as a member of the group represented by each of the eight target nouns as well as the group "Black people" in accordance with the statement, "Black lives matter." Each participant completed 9 randomized trials, where they indicated their answer to the question, "Do you identify as a [singular noun]?" by choosing one of three options: "Yes," "No," or "Confused." We analyzed data from only participants that answered either "Yes" or "No". 

**Likability block.** Finally, we asked participants to report how likable they found each group represented by each of the eight target nouns as well as the group "Black people." Each participant completed 9 randomized trials, where they indicated their answer to the question, "How likable do you find [plural noun]?" by adjusting a slider with endpoints labeled "Extremely likable" on the far right and "Extremely unlikable" on the far left. On each trial, we measured the distance of the slider from the left endpoint: values ranged from 0 to 1. We analyzed data from all participants. The order of the likability and identity blocks was randomized between subjects. 

## Results ## 
![Figure 2](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/ingroupoutgroup_collapsed.pdf "Figure 2. Number of subjects per response, in-group versus out-group.") presents the number of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, separated based on whether the participant identified as a member of the group represented by the noun in the statement shown in the production block. From Figure 2, it is evident that there is very little difference in the proportion of responses allocated to each option between participants when separated by whether or not they identify as a member of the group.   

Then, ![Figure 3](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability2bins_collapsed.pdf "Figure 3. Num subjects per response, likeable versus unlikeable.")) presents the number of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, separated based on whether the participant gave a self-report rating of finding the group represented by the noun in the statement highly likeable or highly unlikeable. Similarly, ![Figure 4](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability3bins_collapsed.pdf ") presents the number of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, separated based on whether the participant gave a self-report rating of finding the group represented by the noun in the statement highly likeable, moderately so, or highly unlikeable.Here we can see somewhat of a difference: more participants who found a group highly likeable responded "Yes" to statements combining that group with positive predicates and "No" to statements combining that group with negative predicates. Contrastingly, more participants who found a group highly unlikeable responded "No" to statements combining that group with positive predicates and "Yes" to statements combining that group with negative predicates. The proportion of "All" and "Not all" responses stayed constant regardless of participant's likeability judgment. 

![Figure 5](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/ingroupoutgroup.pdf) presents the  number of subjects that gave each of the 4 responses, separated by in-group and out-group, collapsed only by predicate. Figure 5 shows that for every statement besides "Black lives matter," the most common response was "Not all". In fact, the only statement where the proportion of responses reflects our hypothesis is "Black lives matter." 

![Figure 6](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability2bins.pdf) presents the  number of subjects that gave each of the 4 responses, separated in terms of whether the participant found the group referenced in the statement highly likeable or highly unlikeable, collapsed only by predicate.

and ![Figure 3](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/means.pdf)

## Discussion ##
A potential cause of this strong effect could be constancy across subjects, since every participant responded to "Black lives matter", unlike the other combinations between noun and predicate.

**Method:**

**Norming Experiment:**

We first conducted a norming experiment to determine which set of positive, negative, and neutral predicates to use. In the norming experiment, participants were presented with a predicate/property. They rated on a sliding scale how good or bad it was for someone to have that property. 

**Test Trial:**

**Design Decisions:**

**Part 1:**

In one trial, each of the eight noun groups will be paired with two positive predicates and two negative predicate. (2 x 8) + (2 x 8).

Each pair of noun groups will be paired with one of the four neutral predicates. (2 x 4). 
(Ex. Men/Women paired with Walk.)

There will be four animal fillers. (4)

One isolated Black Lives Matters. (1)

**Order of radio button selection is shuffled between trials per participant. 

Total 45 Questions.

Include isolated “Black Lives Matter”

Include animal fillers for definite “agree” vs “disagree.” Ex. Chickens Lay Eggs, Pigs Fly

**Part 2:**

Participants will be asked how they feel towards each noun group. 

Total 9 likeability questions. 

**Part 3:**

Participants will show how much they identify towards each noun group. 

Total 9 identity questions. 

**likeability and identity sections are shuffled between trials per participant

Conservatives, and many in the general public, believe that Muslims and immigrants (both legal and unauthorized) make up a dramatically larger share of the population than they actually do."
