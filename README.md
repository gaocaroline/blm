# Black lives matter: The Role of Group Membership and Likability in Exhaustivity Inference #

"Black lives matter" is a statement that has been incendiary and debated in terms of its meaning since its first utterance and the inception of the related social justice movement in 2013. In this study, we hypothesize that the frequent misunderstandings of the phrase, as well as the statements and movements that have risen in reaction to the BLM movement (i.e. All Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter) are a result of incorrectly made exhaustivity inferences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the rate and strength of these exhaustivity inferences is modulated by membership in the group referenced, the valence of the predicate, and subjective perception of the likeability of the group referenced in the statement.

In terms of the factors influencing failed pragmatic inference in the case of the response "All lives matter" to the statement "Black Lives Matter", Degen (2017) proposed that under the Rational Speech Act framework, a full set of logical alternatives to "Black lives matter" is more likely to produce a stronger exhaustivity inference (i.e. "Black lives matter, and no other ones do") than a restricted set of alternatives. Furthermore, she leveraged a modeling approach to show that the restriction of the set of alternatives depends on the question under discussion when "Black lives matter" is uttered. That is, an incorrect exhaustivity inference is more likely to be made if the QUD is "Which lives matter?" compared to "Do Black lives matter?" Finally, she showed that the propensity of a pragmatic listener to converge on one QUD versus another is related to their prior beliefs about which lives have been proven to matter or not in the real world. Still, the claims of the influence of prior beliefs on the QUD, which in turn influences exhaustivity inference rate and strength, requires direct empirical evidence. Thus, the present research aims to directly collect self-reported data to corroborate the claim that "All lives matter" is a failure of pragmatic inference brought on by a set of false prior beliefs about the world that influence listener interpretation of the QUD upon hearing the phrase, "Black lives matter."

With regards to prior beliefs, we sought to distill the concept of a participant's perception of how likable a group is from a participant's membership in a group, as the former is more explicit in terms of a negative or positive sentiment towards a group being referenced in a statement like "Black lives matter" and thus may yield more pronounced effects with regards to strength of exhaustivity inference. However, we still aimed to investigate the role of group membership, in the case where membership may be more salient to exhaustivity inference than perceived likability.

## Experiment 1 ##
The initial norming experiment was intended to obtain participant ratings of 36 different predicates on a sliding scale in order to determine which predicates were considered highly positive, highly negative, and somewhat neutral in valence. We used the results of this experiment to determine which predicates would be used in the target experiment. 

### Method ###
### Participants ###
We recruited 20 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time.

### Design and Methods ###
We asked participants to make a judgment as to whether they thought a predicate was positive, negative, or neutral by answering the question ("How good or bad is it to [predicate]?"). 36 different predicates were tested, where 12 each were informally hypothesized to have relatively high (positive), relatively low (negative), and relatively moderate (neutral) mean ratings. Each participant completed 36 trials, where in each trial, they indicated their answer to the standard question about the predicate by adjusting a slider with endpoints labeled "Very good" on the far right and "Very bad" on the far left. On each trial, we measured the distance of the slider from the left endpoint: values ranged from 0 to 1. We analyzed data from all participants. 

### Results ###
For each predicate, we computed its mean rating by taking the average across all trials completed by all participants that asked about that predicate. 

![Figure 1](../master/results_experiments/1_norming/graphs/means.png "Figure 1. Mean rating of predicates tested in the norming study, clustered according to their hypothesized category (positive, negative, and neutral).") Figure 1 presents the mean rating for each predicate, separated into 3 bins depending on whether we hypothesized that it would be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Greater values mean that a participant thought a predicate was more positive, where lesser values mean that a participant judged a predicate as more negative. When examining the general pattern of results in Figure 1, it becomes apparent that, in general, the predicates hypothesized to be positive all had mean ratings of 0.7 or higher, in accordance with our hypothesis. Similarly, the predicates hypothesized to be negative predominantly had mean ratings of 0.25 or lower. However, from the data it becomes evident that the majority of the predicates hypothesized to be neutral had mean ratings of 0.6 or higher, suggesting that participants thought they were more positive than neutral. 

## Experiment 2 ##
The second experiment sought to examine our primary hypothesis that the strength and rate of exhaustivity inference would depend on the valence of the predicate (positive versus negative versus neutral) as well as group membership (in-group or out-group) and participant rating of group likability for the given noun. 

### Participants ###
We recruited 400 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time. 

### Design and Methods ###
**Production block.** Participants were asked to choose which one of four responses ("All lives matter", "Yes, Black lives matter", "No, Black lives don't matter", "Not all Black lives matter") to a statement consisting of a noun representing a group of people (e.g. "men", "Republicans") paired with a predicate (e.g. "are competent", "cheat") most aligned with how they would naturally respond to the statement. Statements consisted of a noun paired with a predicate. Participants responded to 16 positive statements, where each of eight target nouns was paired with a random two positive predicates (chosen from a collection of six positive predicates), as well as 16 negative statements where each of the target nouns was paired with a random two negative predicates (chosen from a collection of six negative predicates). All predicates were chosen from those evaluated in the norming study, and the positive and negative predicates were as complementary as possible. Participants also responded to 8 neutral statements where each pair of complementary nouns (men/women, Americans/Europeans) was randomly paired with one of four neutral predicates, and four filler statements (two true, two false) intended to serve as a measure of attention. Finally, every participant responded to the statement, "Black lives matter," leading to a total of 45 statements. All nouns and predicates shown in the target study are listed in Appendix B, Table 1, and Table 2. The order of the four responses as well as the order of all trials in the production, likability, and identity blocks were randomized between subjects. 

**Identity block.** We asked participants to report whether or not they identified as a member of the group represented by each of the eight target nouns as well as the group "Black people" in accordance with the statement, "Black lives matter." Each participant completed 9 randomized trials, where they indicated their answer to the question, "Do you identify as a [singular noun]?" by choosing one of three options: "Yes," "No," or "Confused." We analyzed data from only participants that answered either "Yes" or "No". 

**Likability block.** Finally, we asked participants to report how likable they found each group represented by each of the eight target nouns as well as the group "Black people." Each participant completed 9 randomized trials, where they indicated their answer to the question, "How likable do you find [plural noun]?" by adjusting a slider with endpoints labeled "Extremely likable" on the far right and "Extremely unlikable" on the far left. On each trial, we measured the distance of the slider from the left endpoint: values ranged from 0 to 1. We analyzed data from all participants. The order of the likability and identity blocks was randomized between subjects. 

## Results ## 
![Figure 2](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/ingroupoutgroup_collapsed_proportions.png "Figure 2. Number of subjects per response, in-group versus out-group.")  Figure 2 presents the proportion of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, separated based on whether the participant identified as a member of the group represented by the noun in the statement shown in the production block. From Figure 2, it is evident that there is very little difference in the proportion of responses allocated to each option between participants when separated by whether or not they identify as a member of the group. Furthermore, since "Not all" was the most common response by far across predicate and noun, we will focus less on the proportion of "Not all" responses.  

![Figure 3](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability2bins_collapsed_proportions.png "Figure 3. Num subjects per response, likeable versus unlikeable.")) Then, Figure 3 presents the proportion of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, to questions with negative, neutral, and positive predicates. The plots are separated based on whether the participant gave a self-report rating of finding the group represented by the noun in the statement highly likeable or highly unlikeable. ![Figure 4](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability3bins_collapsed_proportions.png ") Similarly, Figure 4 presents the number of subjects that gave "Yes", "No", "Not all", and "All" responses, collapsed by predicate and noun, separated based on whether the participant gave a self-report rating of finding the group represented by the noun in the statement highly likeable, moderately so, or highly unlikeable.Here we can see somewhat of a difference: more participants who found a group highly likeable responded "Yes" to statements combining that group with positive predicates and "No" to statements combining that group with negative predicates. Contrastingly, more participants who found a group highly unlikeable responded "No" to statements combining that group with positive predicates and "Yes" to statements combining that group with negative predicates. The proportion of "All" and "Not all" responses stayed constant regardless of participant's likeability judgment. 

![Figure 5](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/ingroupoutgroup_proportions.png) Figure 5 presents the  proportions of subjects that gave each of the 4 responses to statements with negative, neutral, and positive predicates, separated by in-group and out-group, collapsed only by predicate. Figure 5 shows that for every statement besides "Black lives matter," the most common response was "Not all". In fact, the only statement where the proportion of responses reflects our hypothesis is "Black lives matter." However, there are some other interesting phenomena that arise on a per-noun basis. For example, participants in the out-group never responded "Yes" to positive or negative statements about Americans. Further, for positive statements about Americans, out-group responded with only either "No" or "Not all", whereas for negative statements about Americans, they responded predominantly with "Not all", followed by an equal proportion of "No" and "Everyone" responses. In addition, for statements asking about people in their 50's, participants in the in-group never responded with "Everyone" to positive statements, and never responded "Yes" to negative statements. Otherwise, the proportion of "Everyone" responses was fairly constant across nouns and across positive and negative predicates. Finally, for the most part, more participants in the in-group responded "No" compared to "Yes" to statements with negative predicates, and vice versa; this effect is especially pronounced among statements asking about Democrats and Republicans. 

![Figure 6](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability2bins_proportions.png) ![Figure 7](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/likeability3bins_proportions.png) Figures 6 and 7 show the  proportion of subjects that gave each of the 4 responses, separated in terms of whether the participant found the group referenced in the statement highly likeable or highly unlikeable (in the case of 2 bins) or highly, moderately, and unlikeable (in the case of 3 bins), collapsed only by predicate. The results mirror those found in the in-group out-group plots, where for the most part the relative proportion of "Yes" and "No" responses depends on the participant's likeability of the group and the valence of the predicate in the stimulus. 

Lastly, since the effects of predicate valence and group likeability on the distribution of responses was more pronounced for statements about Democrats and Republicans compared to any other noun that was tested, we decided to specifically examine the individual distributions by predicate for statements asking about those two groups. ![Figure 8](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/republicans_likability_predicates_2bins.png) ![Figure 9](../master/results_experiments/2_blm/graphs/democrats_likability_predicates_2bins.png) Figures 8 and 9 show the number of subjects that gave each of the 4 responses to negative, positive, and neutral statements about Democrats and Republicans, separated by predicate. From Figures 8 and 9 we observed that the strongest effects arose from the statements "Republicans are strong", "Republicans are competent", and "Republicans are incompetent", where participants that found Republicans unlikable by and large responded "Yes" to the negative statements and "No" to the positive statements, as well as vice versa for participants finding Republicans likable. However, because these data reflect only two nouns out of 9 that were tested and were separated by predicate, any observed effects will be less powerful because the data is more sparse. 

## Discussion ##
This study sought to examine the effect of group likability and group membership on the strength and rate of exhaustivity inference. Ultimately, we found that with the exception of the phrase "Black lives matter," group membership and likability did not play a significant role in determining whether a participant would make an exhaustivity inference upon reading a statement with a positively or negatively valenced predicate about a group of people. 

A potential cause of the strong effect observed in response to "Black lives matter" could be constancy across subjects, since every participant responded to "Black lives matter", unlike the other combinations between noun and predicate. Furthermore, we anticipate that because "Black lives matter" and "All lives matter" are just as much monikers for two opposing movements as they are meaningful sentences in and of themselves, participants' choice of response to BLM may have depended more on political belief and prior interaction with the related movements than their interpretation of the sentence in isolation. 

Another potential cause of the predominant lack of strong effects across nouns and predicates might be that our predicates were not have a high enough arousal and thus overwhelmingly primed "Not all" responses compared to the other choices. Future extensions of this work will leverage more arousing predicates to do with more controversial topics, such as race (beyond "Black lives"), religion, and socioeconomic status. 

Additionally, it may be possible that participants' QUD for the various stimuli presented did not vary as systematically or predictably as we expected. More work will need to be done in this area to probe the specific interactions between QUD, group membership, group likability, and predicate valence, possibly by presenting manipulated cover stories prior to the presentation of a statement. 

Finally, it could be beneficial to directly assess participants' prior beliefs with regards to the topics covered in the statements, since it is possible that the prior beliefs surrounding "Black lives matter" are very different and even more salient than those surrounding a statement like "Women are weak."

In one trial, each of the eight noun groups will be paired with two positive predicates and two negative predicate. (2 x 8) + (2 x 8).

Each pair of noun groups will be paired with one of the four neutral predicates. (2 x 4). 
(Ex. Men/Women paired with Walk.)

There will be four animal fillers. (4)

One isolated Black Lives Matters. (1)
