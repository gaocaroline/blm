# Black lives matter: The effect of QUD manipulation on exhaustivity inference #

In 2013, in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who was accused of fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the statement "Black lives matter" rose to prominence, as well as a movement by the same name. Since the the first utterance of "Black lives matter" and the inception of the related movement, the statement has stirred controversy and spurred large amounts of debate as to what the statement means. In turn, this debate over its meaning has inspired reactionary movements like All Lives Matter, as well as disdain towards those reactionary movements from BLM supporters on the grounds that their opponents have grossly misunderstood what "Black lives matter" means. Why is "Black lives" matter so frequently disagreed upon with regards to its meaning? Furthermore, what are we to make of the fact that of all the different meanings the statement could have, the majority of people ascribe to one of two possible meanings, subsequently aligning with either the original movement or the "All Lives Matter" counterpart? In this study, we aimed to answer these questions by hypothesizing that the primary factor affecting whether a listener agrees with the statement "Black lives matter" or responds to it saying "All lives matter" is the strength and type of pragmatic inference drawn upon hearing it. Then, we investigated what aspects of the listener or speaker have an effect, if any, on pragmatic inferences drawn in response to "Black lives matter" and statements like it.

Pragmatic inference is defined as an inductive inference which, if true, yield conclusions containing new semantic information about the world beyond what is contained in any premises (Johnson-Laird, 1993). A specific variety of pragmatic inference drawn in the context of language understanding is an exhaustivity inference, in which a listener infers whether or not a set of items in an utterance they have heard is an exhaustive list or not (Zimmermann, 2000). For example, an exhaustivity inference that a listener may draw from the statement "John had steak for dinner last night" would be that John had a steak for dinner last night and nothing else, i.e. that the list that the speaker put forth as things that John ate for dinner was exhaustive. In this study, we hypothesize that the frequent misunderstandings of the phrase, as well as the statements and movements that have risen in reaction to the BLM movement (i.e. All Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter) are a result of incorrectly made exhaustivity inferences. In other words, what determines whether a listener will align with "Black lives matter" or "All lives matter" is whether or not they infer that "Black lives matter" means "Black lives matter, and no other ones do."

In terms of the factors influencing failed pragmatic inference in the case of the response "All lives matter" to the statement "Black Lives Matter", Degen (2017) proposed that under the Rational Speech Act framework, a full set of logical alternatives to "Black lives matter" is more likely to produce a stronger exhaustivity inference (i.e. "Black lives matter, and no other ones do") than a restricted set of alternatives. Furthermore, she leveraged a modeling approach to show that the restriction of the set of alternatives depends on the question under discussion when "Black lives matter" is uttered. That is, an incorrect exhaustivity inference is more likely to be made if the QUD is "Which lives matter?" compared to "Do Black lives matter?" Finally, she showed that the propensity of a pragmatic listener to converge on one QUD versus another is related to their prior beliefs about which lives have been proven to matter or not in the real world. Still, the claims of the influence of prior beliefs on the QUD, which in turn influences exhaustivity inference rate and strength, requires direct empirical evidence. Thus, the present research aims to directly collect self-reported data to corroborate the claim that "All lives matter" is a failure of pragmatic inference brought on by a set of false prior beliefs about the world that influence listener interpretation of the QUD upon hearing the phrase, "Black lives matter."

There is evidence to show that by using cover stories, listener interpretation of QUD can be implicitly manipulated, leading to differing pragmatic inferences. Degen & Goodman (2014) investigated the effect of QUD and contextually available set size on scalar implicatures using the sentence verification paradigm. They found that participants were more likely to draw a scalar implicature when they were presented with a cover story that primed a scalar implicature. In this paper, we explore an application of such a methodology to exhaustivity inference, positing that systematic manipulation of priming cover stories can influence a listener to draw an exhaustivity inference or not.

We will present results from an experiment testing our primary hypotheses that the misunderstanding of "Black lives matter" is an incorrectly and strongly drawn exhaustivity inference affected by the contextually evoked QUD, which we will manipulate by presenting different cover stories to listeners and asking them to answer questions about an utterance related to the cover story.

We recruited 400 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time. 

###Design and Methods###

Example cover story: Michelle is a software developer at Apple, where she works on the Apple Music team and builds a variety of features related to the music streaming service. The other day at her team's weekly meeting, her boss unveiled that they would be working on a new project to make individualized playlists for users automatic instead of hand-curated. Michelle was really excited about the prospect of working on the new project, but to her dismay, her boss said the team for the project had already been chosen based on their high level of competence. Upon listing the names of the other team members, Michelle realized that all of the team members were coworkers of hers who she found to be highly competent, but that they were all men. She raised her hand to speak in the meeting and said, "Women are competent."

Utterance: Women are competent

Question: Who does Michelle believe to be competent? 
- Men and not women 
- Women and not men 
- Women and men 
- Neither women nor men
