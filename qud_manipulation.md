# Black lives matter: The effect of QUD manipulation on exhaustivity inference #

There is evidence to show that by using cover stories, listener interpretation of QUD can be implicitly manipulated, leading to differing pragmatic inferences. Degen & Goodman (2014) investigated the effect of QUD and contextually available set size on scalar implicatures using the sentence verification paradigm. They found that participants were more likely to draw a scalar implicature when they were presented with a cover story that primed a scalar implicature. In this paper, we explore an application of such a methodology to exhaustivity inference, positing that systematic manipulation of priming cover stories can influence a listener to draw an exhaustivity inference or not.

We will present results from an experiment testing our primary hypotheses that the misunderstanding of "Black lives matter" is an incorrectly and strongly drawn exhaustivity inference affected by the contextually evoked QUD, which we will manipulate by presenting different cover stories to listeners and asking them to answer questions about an utterance related to the cover story.

###Participants###
We recruited 400 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their time. 

###Design and Methods###

Example cover story: Michelle is a software developer at Apple, where she works on the Apple Music team and builds a variety of features related to the music streaming service. The other day at her team's weekly meeting, her boss unveiled that they would be working on a new project to make individualized playlists for users automatic instead of hand-curated. Michelle was really excited about the prospect of working on the new project, but to her dismay, her boss said the team for the project had already been chosen based on their high level of competence. Upon listing the names of the other team members, Michelle realized that all of the team members were coworkers of hers who she found to be highly capable, but that they were all men. She raised her hand to speak in the meeting and said, "Women are competent."

Utterance: Women are competent

Question: Who does Michelle believe to be competent? 
- Men and not women 
- Women and not men 
- Women and men 
- Neither women nor men

Concerns: adding different predicates, different groups (keep men/women, Dems/Reps)

#analysis from last quarter#
log reg predicting yes vs. 
response (yes versus not yes) as a function of membership/likability interacting with predicate valence
Mixed effects model accounts for individual subject and item variability 

Random effects assumption: probability/error (normally distributed with a mean of zero) of deviation from the linear smoother
